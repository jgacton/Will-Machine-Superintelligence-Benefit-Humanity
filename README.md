**Will Machine Superintelligence Benefit Humanity?**

I wrote this essay during my final year of high school as my A-Level extended project. It covers ideas about intelligence, AI, superintelligence, existential risk and takes notions from other subjects such as economics and game theory. For it I recieved a mark of 50/50, grade A*.
